<p>You’ll find this post in your <code>_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code>jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>To add new posts, simply add a file in the <code>_posts</code> directory that follows the convention <code>YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext</code> and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ocaml" data-lang="ocaml"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">print_name</span> <span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">print_endline</span> <span class="n">name</span> 
<span class="n">print_name</span> <span class="s2">&quot;chris&quot;</span> <span class="o">;;</span> 
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">unix</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">()</span> <span class="s2">&quot;chris&quot;</span></code></pre></div>
