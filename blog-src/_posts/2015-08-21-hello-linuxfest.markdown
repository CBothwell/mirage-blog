# Hello Linux Fest

I just thought I would put together a quick post about my day at Linux Fest. So far we've gotten a nice overview about Unikernels from Russel Pavlicek and Gotten a nice introduction to the rump kernel from Justin Cormack. 

I'm looking forward to the OSv talk by Roman Shaposhnik and my own about deploying Mirage Unikernels.
