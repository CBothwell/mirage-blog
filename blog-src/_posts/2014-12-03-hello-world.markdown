Hello. I see you've managed to stumble upon my first post here. Honestly, I just wanted to get something out. [Jekyll][jekyll-gh] seems to be a sufficiently complex tool and, like most times I have my first experience. I suppose I expect most folks that due this sort of thing are domain experts, or at least think they are. Suffice to say, I am not. Mostly I just see some bit of new technology or new idea and seek to gorge myself on the documentation, try a few things out, and then just move on...like a buffet. So in the interest of keeping this a correct introduction here is the proverbial hello world. 

{% highlight ocaml %} 
let () = print_endline "Hello, world!"

{% endhighlight %} 

At any rate, one thing I've been looking at recently has been [Mirage][mirage-home] and learning about how to setup a unikernel to run on a Xen instance in the cloud. If you see this, than I was probably successful and I'll do a follow up post with my experience. Otherwise, it probably won't matter much what I've said here anyway.
